## What is SEO?

SEO (Search Engineer Optimization) is the process of making your website more visible and attractive to search engines. When people search for something that is related to your content, it helps your website show up higher in the search results.

### Why Is SEO Important?

It is important that your website shows up high in the results because a study by [Sistrix](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-first-page-clicks/374516/) showed that 28.5 percent of people click the first result that shows up on a page in a search engine with the percentages sharply dropping off each result lower, while almost no one clicks on results on the second page.

**SEO is important because:**

- **Credibilty:** it helps more people find your portfolio higher rankings mean you have more trust and social proof, 

- **Traffic without ads:** you get traffic without having to pay for ads

- **Better UX:** SEI improvements (faster loading, good structure, acessible markup) improves the user experience. 

### Types of SEO

There are three main pillars of SEO. Those pillars are 

1. On-Page SEO - Things you directly control in your code:

- Titles, description, headings.

- Keywords in text.

- Clean urls (/about-me instead of /page?id=2).

- Metada like Open Graph, Twitter Cards, canonical links

- Schema markup (JSON-LD) that gives search engines structured meaning. 

2. Techincal SEO - How well your site is built under the hood:

- Fast loading, mobile-friendly.

- Secure (HTTPS).

- Sitemap and robotos.txt

- Correct canonical URLs (avoid duplicate content issues).

- Indexability (ensuring pages can be crawled and stored).

3. Off-Page SEO - How the wider internet sees your site:

- Backlinks(other sites linking to yours = votes of trust).

- Social signals (shares, mentions).

- Online reputation.
